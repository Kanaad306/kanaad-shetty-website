          <p>
            After years of working on AI/ML projects, I've learned that the
            hardest part isn't building the model—it's building something people
            will actually use. Too many AI products end up as shelfware,
            impressive demos that never make it into production or, worse, go
            live but get abandoned within weeks.
          </p>

          <h3>The Shelfware Problem</h3>
          <p>
            I've seen it happen countless times: a team builds an amazing ML
            model with 95% accuracy, everyone celebrates, and then... nothing.
            The model sits unused because nobody thought about how it would fit
            into existing workflows, or the predictions arrive too slowly, or
            the output format doesn't match what users need.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem is that we often start with the technology instead of
            the problem. We get excited about new techniques—transformer models,
            reinforcement learning, whatever's trending—and look for problems to
            apply them to. But that's backwards.
          </p>

          <h3>Start with the Problem, Not the Solution</h3>
          <p>
            The best AI products I've worked on started with a real, painful
            problem that people were desperate to solve. We didn't ask "how can
            we use AI here?" We asked "what's making people's lives harder?" and
            only then considered whether AI might help.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, one of our most successful projects came from watching
            analysts spend hours manually categorizing customer feedback. They
            hated it. We built a simple classifier that wasn't perfect—maybe 85%
            accurate—but it saved them hours every week. They loved it because
            it solved their actual problem.
          </p>

          <h3>Three Questions to Ask Before Building</h3>
          <p>Before starting any AI project, I now ask:</p>

          <p>
            <strong>1. What happens if this doesn't work perfectly?</strong> If
            your model needs 99% accuracy to be useful, you're probably in
            trouble. Build for graceful degradation. Let users verify and
            correct predictions. Make it easy to fall back to manual processes
            when needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>2. Will this fit into existing workflows?</strong> People
            won't change their entire process to accommodate your AI. Your
            solution needs to slot into what they're already doing, or make the
            change so obviously better that they'll adopt it immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3. Can we measure the actual impact?</strong> Not model
            accuracy—real impact. Time saved, errors prevented, money made. If
            you can't measure it, you can't prove it's worth maintaining.
          </p>

          <h3>Ship Fast, Iterate Faster</h3>
          <p>
            The other lesson: don't wait for perfection. We shipped our feedback
            classifier when it was "good enough" and improved it based on how
            people actually used it. Turns out they cared way more about speed
            than accuracy for certain categories, which completely changed our
            optimization strategy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Building AI products that people use isn't about the fanciest
            algorithms or the highest benchmark scores. It's about understanding
            real problems, fitting into real workflows, and proving real value.
            Everything else is just details.
