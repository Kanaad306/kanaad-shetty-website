          <p>
            I'm not a career coder. My background is in business analysis and
            project management, not computer science. But over the past few
            years, I've gone from writing SQL queries to building agentic AI
            systems. Here's how that happened.
          </p>

          <h3>The Accidental Start</h3>
          <p>
            It started with curiosity. I was managing AI/ML projects, translating
            between engineers and stakeholders, and I kept wondering: what's
            actually happening under the hood? I could explain what a model did
            at a high level, but I wanted to understand how.
          </p>

          <p>
            So I started small. Python tutorials. Pandas for data analysis. Basic
            scikit-learn models. Nothing fancy—just enough to follow along when
            engineers talked about training data and feature engineering.
          </p>

          <h3>The Turning Point</h3>
          <p>
            The real shift came when I stopped just learning and started
            building. I had a problem at work: our team was manually tracking
            project updates across multiple tools, and things kept falling
            through the cracks. I thought, "could I automate this?"
          </p>

          <p>
            My first attempt was terrible. Buggy code, fragile integrations,
            barely worked. But it worked enough to be useful. And more
            importantly, I learned more from building that one thing than from
            months of tutorials.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning by Prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            That became my approach: learn by building things that solve real
            problems. Each project taught me something new. An API integration
            here, a data pipeline there, gradually more complex systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            When LLMs exploded onto the scene, I was fascinated. Not because of
            the hype, but because they solved a problem I'd always struggled
            with: making AI systems that could handle unstructured, messy,
            real-world data. Suddenly, prototypes that would've taken weeks could
            be built in days.
          </p>

          <h3>The AI Exploration Phase</h3>
          <p>
            Now I'm deep into prompt engineering, RAG systems, and agentic
            frameworks. Building tools that use LLMs to automate workflows,
            analyze data, and assist with decision-making. It's not about being a
            "real programmer"—it's about using these tools to solve problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            The business analysis background actually helps. I think about user
            needs, edge cases, what happens when things break. I focus on
            building systems that people will actually use, not just impressive
            demos.
          </p>

          <h3>Advice for Other Non-Coders</h3>
          <p>
            If you're in a similar position—working with AI but not from a coding
            background—here's what worked for me:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Start with a real problem.</strong> Don't just do tutorials.
            Build something you actually need, even if it's small and messy.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Embrace being a beginner.</strong> Your code won't be
            perfect. That's fine. Make it work first, make it better later.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Use your domain expertise.</strong> You understand the
            business context, the user needs, the real-world constraints.
            That's incredibly valuable when building AI systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            The AI field is moving so fast that everyone's learning constantly.
            Being a "non-coder" matters less than being curious, persistent, and
            focused on solving real problems. Just start building.
